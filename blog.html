    <h2>Festive Night</h2>
    <p>
        From early in the morning until late at night, enjoy the breathtaking views of the Orizontes Roof Garden Bar-Restaurant. For breakfast, lunch or dinner, for a light mid-day snack, for your coffee or your aperitif, and for a fabulous night with drinks overlooking the glowing, energetic city center square below, the Orizontes Roof Garden restaurant and bar is an experience to be savored, over and over again. Featuring a rich breakfast selection, delicious lunch and dinner menus echoing the cultural traditions of the city, refreshing cocktails and, of course, commanding views that expand from mount Olympus, to the sea, to the city’s Walls, to the Sheikh Sou forest, the Orizontes is without a doubt the most romantic Thessaloniki restaurant one can find in the city center.

    <h2>Spoil Yourself</h2>
    <p>
        Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of another era at the Excelsior bar, in the lobby of the Electra Palace Thessaloniki. Among the elegant wood paneling, beside the roaming fireplace, sink into the chesterfield sofas to savor a rare single malt whiskey, or a French cognac – or to enjoy your expertly prepared coffee. Styled after a traditional british clubhouse, the Excelsior is one of the few Thessaloniki bars with its own distinct identity, one you will adore!

    <h2>Sweet Dreams With the Sweeties Cakes</h2>
    <p>
        "An unconventional pavlova that’s perfect as a celebration cake, this was created accidentally one day at Kepos Street Kitchen when we were trying to make a unique gluten-free cake for a customer. It is a versatile recipe so you can change the type of nuts and berries you use – don’t be afraid to put your own stamp on it. You can also make it look more like a regular pavlova by omitting the glaze and adding cream and pomegranate seeds." Book extract from Falafel for Breakfast by Michael Rantissi and Kristy Frawley (Murdoch Books)
